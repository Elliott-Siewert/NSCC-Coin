# NSCC-Coin
Experimental cryptocurrency built by Nova Scotia Community College Students

This project was started as part of my self directed studies course at NSCC.
It is based largely on a tutorial by Lauri Hartikka on how to create a basic cryptocurrency from scratch https://lhartikk.github.io/

Install:
- make sure nodejs is installed https://nodejs.org/en/
- from the terminal navigate to the project folder and run the following commands:
    - npm install
    - node .\NSCCCoinNode.js
  This will start a new node.
- If you wish to start mining open a new terminal and run the miner script.
    - node .\NSCCCoinMiner.js

You can use the node api endpoints by using postman
There is a basic Wallet UI that can be used to view you balance and address as well as to send transactions. In order for it to work you will need to have a cross origin extenstion installed on your browser.
